For a long time, I wanted to write about something, but I could never force myself to do it. The idea of producing something and expressing myself stayed with me for a long time.

So, finally I decided to start a blog. Here are some reasons why I started blogging and why it is a great way of expressing yourself.

## It's an outlet for self expression

Blogging allows you to express yourself. There are other ways to create content online, such as making videos, posting photos,... But writing seems like the best fit for me currently.

## It makes you a better writer

The more you do something, the better you will be at it. And writing is a skill I would like to improve.

When you write you must organize your thoughts, which helps you develop critical thinking. It makes you a better communicator, which is a crucial skill to have in life.

Researching and creating content also involves learning new information. Learning new things is really important for your well-being.

## It's a great way of networking

When you blog online, you can attract other like-minded individuals. That can lead to forming new connections and friendships.

## It documents your journey

When you write online, it can serve as a journal where you can reflect later and see your growth over time.

## Conclusion

I always had this fear of the article I publish not being perfect, but I have realized that it **cannot possibly be perfect anyway**, so why not try? That's why for the year 2024 I have a goal of writing **12 blog posts**. It seems like an achievable goal. Hopefully I will be consistent enough to write at least a post a month.

I am going to show you what tech, both software and hardware I am using when working and in free time.

## Operating system

I am using **Debian** Linux as an operating system. I have switched from Windows roughly 3 years ago. It feels way better for me to program and work on Linux than on Windows. Although there were growing pains when transitioning to Linux because it requires you to change your mindset a little.

Once I got used to the _linux way_ of working, I was much more comfortable programming and doing casual stuff on Linux. It also isn't as resource heavy as Windows 11.

There are many distributions I tried, but finally I settled on Debian, because it is stable and there is a great amount of resources when it comes to programming.

## Text editor

As a text editor I am using **VS Code**. It works great and has many 3rd party extensions that enhance my productivity. The theme I am using is **GitHub Dark Default**.

As a terminal emulator I am using Alacritty.

## Browser

I'am using **Firefox Developer Edition**. It works great for me. Here are the extensions I am using:

- uBlock Origin - ad blocking
- Unhook - for hiding YouTube feed so I am not distracted
- Bitwarden - for managing passwords

## Computer

I am using desktop PC for working. I got it in 2018 and it still works just as well. Over the years I have upgraded RAM and SSD. Here are the specs:

- CPU: Intel i5 8600k
- RAM: 16GB 3600MHz
- GPU: GTX 1050Ti
- SSD: 500GB NVMe

## Keyboard

**Keychron K8 Pro** with red switches. It is amazing. I had brown switches before but they were too loud for my liking.

## Monitor

**27" 1440p 144Hz Asus**. It works really well. I currently have single monitor setup because I feel like if I had more monitors I would be more distracted and at the end it would hurt my productivity.

## Chair

**MARKUS** from Ikea. It's comfortable to sit in for me.
